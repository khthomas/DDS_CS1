# Analysis of Craft Breweries in the United States.

The primary goal of this analysis was to understand the craft brewery market in the United States. 
There were additional sub goals including:

* Merging two datasets so that linked beer production with brewery location
* Find the median International Biterness Unit (IBU) content of beers on a state by state basis.
* Find the median Alochol Content By Volumne (ABV) of beers on a state by state basis.
* Generate visualizations so that this data can be quickly and easily understood.
* Determine which state had the strongest beer (highest IBU)
* Determine which state had the most bitter beer (highest ABV) 
* Determine if there is a relationship between bitterness and alcohol content.

This data was fairly close to tidy data. So the process used to clean and merge the data sets are fairly straight forward.
However, this data can be found in the codebook linked within this document.

## Documents containted within this repo
1. "Beers.csv" - this CSV file contains relatvent information regarding the beers (ABV, IBU, beer name, beer style, and serving size)
2. "Breweries.csv" - this CSV file contains relavent information regarding the breweries (brewery name, state, and city of the brewery)
3. A R Markdown file
4. A HTML version of the RMD output
